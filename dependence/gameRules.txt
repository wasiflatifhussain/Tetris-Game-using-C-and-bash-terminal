Welcome to Tetris.
The rules of the game are simple. Try to align the blocks
to form a perfect horizontal line. If a horizontal line
forms, that line disappears. The game continues.
=> Use 'W/w' or 'S/s button to change the orientation of the blocks.
=> Using 'A/a' and 'D/d' to move the block right and left.
=> Use 'E/e' to end the game.

Defeat: The game ends if a vertical line of block pieces
forms which touches the upper edge of the board!

Good Luck! Have Fun! Enjoy!
